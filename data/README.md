# Data Directory

This directory contains the data files for the Harmonia Occulta project.

## Directory Structure

- `images/`: Source images of Robert Fludd's works
  - Place high-resolution scans of the Monochordum Mundi and related diagrams here
  - Recommended format: TIFF or PNG (lossless)
  - Example: `monochordum_mundi.tif`

- `measurements/`: Extracted measurements and coordinates
  - This directory will contain CSV/JSON files with extracted measurements
  - Files will be generated by the analysis scripts

- `text/`: Source texts and character frequency data
  - Include any digitized texts or transcriptions here
  - Can include character frequency analysis results

## Data Sources

Primary source images should be obtained from the Wellcome Collection's digital archive of Robert Fludd's works or other appropriate repositories. Please ensure you have the necessary rights to use and distribute any included data.

## File Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with underscores for file names (e.g., `fludd_monochord_measurements.csv`)
- Include a date in YYYYMMDD format in the filename for different versions
- For images, include resolution in the filename (e.g., `monochord_600dpi.tif`)

## Data Processing

All data processing scripts should be in the `src/` directory, with outputs saved to the `outputs/` directory. Raw data files should remain unmodified in this directory.
